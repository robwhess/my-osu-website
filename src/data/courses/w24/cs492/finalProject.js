  preamble: 'For the final project in this course, you will work in teams to implement a complete Android app that gets data from a third-party API.  The project will have three deliverables: a proposal, where you outline the app you\'d like to write; an implementation of your app; and a brief evaluation of your project team.  Follow the links below to find out more about each of these deliverables.'
