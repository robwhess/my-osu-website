Notes can be pinned, categorized, privated, searched, and filtered, can be composed via voice input, and are backed up and synced between devices over the cloud. Noteworthy is built in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose and Material 2 as the design system. OpenAI's GPT-3 LLM is used for AI generations, Google SpeechRecognizer is used for voice recognition, and Firebase Cloud Functions, Firestore, and Algolia are used for the database and search engine.",

Race against the clock as you try to find the shortest possible path to the target actor using their shared filmography as you groove to the gameâ€™s background music. CineLink uses The Movie Database API to source actor and movie credits as well as images to represent them.",
